Project Plan Checklist: Permission - Department - Permission Group Analysis


---

1. Define Objective and Scope

[ ] Clarify primary question (patterns, recommendations, anomaly detection)

[ ] Define outputs (report, dashboard, model)

[ ] Identify stakeholders and success criteria


2. Understand and Inspect Raw Data

[ ] Collect all relevant datasets

[ ] Understand columns and data types

[ ] Check for missing values and duplicates

[ ] Identify table relationships (e.g. user -> role -> dept -> permission -> group)


3. Clean the Data

[ ] Remove duplicates

[ ] Handle missing values

[ ] Standardize formats and categories

[ ] Validate keys and links between tables


4. Explore and Visualize Basic Distributions

[ ] Count of permissions per department

[ ] Count of permissions per role

[ ] Count of permissions per permission group

[ ] Count of permission groups per department and role

[ ] Identify common and rare permission groups


5. Analyze Relationships Between Categories

[ ] Build cross-tabulations (dept x group, role x group)

[ ] Create heatmaps or frequency tables

[ ] Explore co-occurrence patterns

[ ] Flag unexpected combinations or anomalies


6. Feature Engineering

[ ] Create new features (number of groups, common groups, rare groups)

[ ] Add binary flags for anomalies

[ ] Generate cluster labels if needed


7. (Optional) Build Models or Rules

[ ] Run clustering algorithms to group similar profiles

[ ] Build rule-based recommendation logic

[ ] Identify anomalies using anomaly detection techniques


8. Summarize Insights

[ ] Prepare summary tables or dashboards

[ ] Document typical patterns

[ ] List rare/unusual permission assignments

[ ] Draft recommendations


9. Document and Share

[ ] Document findings, methods, and results

[ ] Prepare visuals and summaries for stakeholders

[ ] Share recommendations and proposed next steps


10. Plan for Maintenance and Future Development

[ ] Define plan to refresh and update analysis

[ ] Identify automation opportunities

[ ] Gather feedback and iterate
